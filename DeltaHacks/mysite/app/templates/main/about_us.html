        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>Community Capital Connect</strong>, a platform dedicated to fostering financial equity and inclusion.
            Our mission is to empower individuals from marginalized communities by providing them with an innovative solution to
            access low-interest loans through collective resource pooling.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            We envision a world where financial barriers are dismantled, and every individual, regardless of their background, has
            access to fair and equitable financial resources. By enabling communities to pool their resources, we aim to create a
            supportive ecosystem for financial growth and stability.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            Our platform connects individuals within a community to collectively contribute to a resource pool. These funds are
            then used to provide low-interest loans to those in need, ensuring transparency, fairness, and mutual benefit. The
            process is supported by trusted NGOs, microfinance institutions, and crowdfunding efforts to maximize impact.
        </p>
